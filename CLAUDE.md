# Coding style
- Claude is allowed to edit file and folder
- Versioning is important. Use GIT with trunk based development strategy
- Save work in feature branches and let me review, give feedback and eventually merge them.
- Use branch names which refer to the task id and a short human description
- Use conventional commit messages
- Add structured logging messages
- Write test cases
- All tests shall pass so that a feature branch is ready to be integrated
- Tests on main branch might fail but shall be fixed before other features are integrated
- no need to confirm command
